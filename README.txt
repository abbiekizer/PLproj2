Game with a hidden agenda

This go program has two channels, one which engages the user in gameplay and
one which factors large numbers in the background. The list of large numbers
is a file called numbers.txt. Channel 1 reads in numbers from this file and
factors them. It then writes to a file where it prints the factors of the
numbers.
